Decision: Countries should prepare contingency strategies and maintain performance even during geopolitical challenges or disrupted Olympic cycles.

## 🏆 5. Specialization vs Diversification
Insight: Some countries excel in specific sports, while others have a broader presence across disciplines.

Decision: Countries can choose to specialize in a few sports for quick medal gains or diversify efforts for long-term balanced success.

## 📈 6. Focus on Upcoming Talent Pools
Insight: Younger countries with increasing medal counts (like South Korea, Australia) show rising performance curves.

Decision: Analyze emerging nations to understand how youth development programs and sports academies are structured for long-term success.

## 📅 7. Year-over-Year Performance Auditing
